# Node.js

Execute JavaScript and TypeScript, install npm dependencies, and manage execution lifecycles in agentOS.

agentOS runs JavaScript and TypeScript on native V8 inside the VM, backed by a
real Node.js surface: `node:fs`, `node:child_process`, sockets, and npm.

Letting an agent write code instead of chaining one tool call per step is called
[Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/). It has a few advantages over
driving [Bash](/agentos/docs/bash):

- **Fewer tokens**: Ten chained operations cost one round trip, not ten.
- **Type checking**: Validate generated TypeScript before you run it.
- **Real data processing**: `map` and `filter` instead of `jq` and `awk`.
- **Parallelism**: `Promise.all` instead of shell job control.

## Evaluate an expression

`evaluate()` returns a JSON-serializable value.

Returning `undefined`, a function, a symbol, or a circular value fails with
`evaluation_serialization_failed` rather than silently losing the value.

## Execute code

`execute()` runs source and captures its output instead of returning a value.

Executions are ephemeral, so capture stdio only when you want it — `"stderr"` for
diagnostics, `"all"` for both streams. `onStdout`/`onStderr` stream live and work
independently of capture.

## Pass data into code

`inputs` hands host values to the guest as real objects, so data never gets
interpolated into source.

## Keep state between calls

Pass a `contextId` to keep globals, imports, and modules alive across calls in
one retained V8 isolate.

A context runs one operation at a time — reusing a busy `contextId` fails
immediately. Files, npm, Bash, and type checks may pass the same id, but they run
in fresh processes and never touch retained memory.

Contexts live for the VM lifetime. They do not survive actor sleep/wake, because
the VM is disposed; create them lazily on the first stateful use after wake.

## Type check before running

Executing TypeScript transpiles it without a semantic check, so validate the
agent's generated code explicitly.

## Install npm packages

Installs modify the VM-wide filesystem, so a package installed once is importable
by every later execution in that VM, in any language. Only one npm/Python
mutation runs at a time per VM; a concurrent install fails with `execution_busy`.

## Background processes and web servers

`spawn` starts a long-lived process and returns a `pid`. From there you get
stdin, output, signals, and waiting.

Spawned processes always start with fresh state, so they take no `contextId`.

## A full Linux environment underneath

There is a real Linux environment behind all of this, shared by every language.
Files and installed packages are immediately visible to Bash, Python, agents, and
other executions.

See [Filesystem](/agentos/docs/filesystem), [Processes & Shells](/agentos/docs/processes), and
[Networking & Previews](/agentos/docs/networking).

## Bindings

Guest code invokes [bindings](/agentos/docs/bindings) as ordinary typed commands, so host
credentials stay outside the VM.

## Permissions, limits, and timeouts

Every operation inherits the VM [permission policy](/agentos/docs/permissions) and
[resource limits](/agentos/docs/resource-limits).

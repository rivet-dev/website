# External Sandboxes

Extend agentOS with full sandboxes for heavy workloads like browsers, desktop automation, and compilation.

Pair agentOS with a full sandbox on demand for heavy workloads. The sandbox
filesystem mounts into the VM as a native directory, and its process management
is exposed as [bindings](/agentos/docs/bindings) — provider-agnostic through
[Sandbox Agent](https://sandboxagent.dev).

- agentOS covers most use cases; a sandbox adds a full Linux environment for
  special software.
- Lazily start a sandbox only when a task needs it, then tear it down.
- One agent session can mix lightweight coding with heavy system work.
- See [agentOS vs Sandbox](/agentos/docs/versus-sandbox) for the full comparison.

## When to use a sandbox

- **Native binaries** not yet supported in the agentOS runtime.
- **Browsers / desktop automation** — Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, anything
  needing a display server.
- **Heavy compilation** — large builds or native toolchains.
- **GUI apps** — desktop apps, VNC, graphical workloads.
- **npm packages with native extensions** — `sharp`, `bcrypt`,
  `better-sqlite3`.

Default to the agentOS VM; spin up a sandbox only when required. Sandboxes bill
per second of uptime.

## Getting started

Ships as `@rivet-dev/agentos-sandbox`, working through two mechanisms:

- **Filesystem mount** — projects the sandbox into the VM as a native
  directory. Read/write files through the mount.
- **Bindings** — exposes sandbox process management as
  [bindings](/agentos/docs/bindings). Run commands on the sandbox from the VM.

Both powered by [Sandbox Agent](https://sandboxagent.dev); swap providers
without changing agent code.

```bash
npm install @rivet-dev/agentos-sandbox sandbox-agent
```

- `createSandboxFs`, `createSandboxBindings` — from `@rivet-dev/agentos-sandbox`.
- `SandboxAgent` + provider helpers (e.g. `docker`) — from `sandbox-agent`.
- Pass a provider as `sandbox: { provider: docker() }`. agentOS starts the
  client, mounts it at `/mnt/sandbox`, registers process bindings, and disposes
  it with the VM.
- In RivetKit actors, pass the provider to `agentOS(...)` — a fresh client per
  actor VM.

## Configuration

The sandbox is mounted at `/mnt/sandbox` by default. The `sandbox` object also
accepts these options alongside `provider` or `client`:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mountPath` | Changes the directory where the external filesystem appears inside the agentOS VM. |
| `sandboxRoot` | Restricts the mount to a directory inside the external sandbox instead of exposing its root. |
| `readOnly` | Prevents the VM from modifying files through the mount. Defaults to `false`. |
| `timeoutMs` | Sets the per-request timeout for Sandbox Agent filesystem calls. |
| `maxFullReadBytes` | Bounds files buffered by full-read and truncate fallbacks. |

The server example above changes `mountPath` to
`/home/agentos/sandbox`. Paths used inside the external sandbox remain relative
to `sandboxRoot`, so a VM file such as `/home/agentos/sandbox/app/index.ts` maps
to `/app/index.ts` when `sandboxRoot` is `/`.

## Calling the mounted bindings

Write code through the filesystem, run it inside the sandbox. Bindings are a CLI
command, called through the same `exec`/`spawn` surface as any command.

## Bindings reference

```bash
# Run a command synchronously
agentos-sandbox run-command --command "npm install" --cwd "/app"

# Start a background process
agentos-sandbox create-process --command "npm" --args "run" --args "dev"

# List running processes
agentos-sandbox list-processes

# Get process output
agentos-sandbox get-process-logs --id "proc_abc123"

# Stop or kill a process
agentos-sandbox stop-process --id "proc_abc123"
agentos-sandbox kill-process --id "proc_abc123"

# Send input to an interactive process
agentos-sandbox send-input --id "proc_abc123" --data "yes"
```

## Sandbox providers

The package provides isolated entrypoints for Docker, local execution, E2B,
Daytona, Vercel, Cloudflare, Modal, ComputeSDK, and Sprites. Import only the
provider you use (for example, `@rivet-dev/agentos-sandbox/e2b`) so its optional
SDK is isolated from the rest of your application. Docker is also exported from
the package root, as shown above.

Install the provider's SDK when required: `@e2b/code-interpreter` for E2B,
`@daytonaio/sdk` for Daytona, `@vercel/sandbox` for Vercel,
`@cloudflare/sandbox` for Cloudflare, `modal` for Modal, `computesdk` for
ComputeSDK, or `@fly/sprites` for Sprites. Docker and local execution need no
additional provider SDK.

For another backend, adapt any [Sandbox Agent](https://sandboxagent.dev)
provider with `sandboxAgentProvider` from `@rivet-dev/agentos-sandbox`. Provider
mode is the preferred lifecycle: each VM gets a fresh sandbox, and disposal of
the VM destroys it.

## Advanced: mount an existing client

Standalone `AgentOs.create()` can mount an already-connected,
Sandbox-Agent-compatible client. Install `sandbox-agent` directly for this
manual path. The caller owns the client by default; set `dispose` to `true` when
the client implements disposal, or provide a callback to transfer lifecycle
ownership to the VM.

RivetKit `agentOS()` intentionally rejects the `client` form because one client
cannot be shared safely across actor VMs. Pass a `provider` there so every actor
VM starts and owns a fresh sandbox.

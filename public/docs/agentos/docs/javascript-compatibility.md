# Node.js Compatibility

Node.js builtins available to JavaScript running inside AgentOS.

Guest JavaScript never touches the host Node.js runtime.

- Every `node:` `import`/`require` resolves to a VM-backed bridge or an
  in-isolate implementation.
- Unknown or denied modules fail explicitly with `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`.
- The guest reports Node.js `v22.0.0` via `process.version`.

How builtins are backed:

- **VM-backed** — routes through the VM filesystem, sockets, processes, DNS, or
  entropy.
- **In-isolate** — pure JavaScript running inside V8; no host access.
- **Denied** — importing throws `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`.

<Note>A guest never falls through to a real host builtin. Anything not bridged
or implemented in the isolate is denied.</Note>

## VM-backed builtins

| Module | Backed by |
| --- | --- |
| `fs`, `fs/promises` | VM filesystem: fds, streams, metadata, symlinks, polling watchers. |
| `child_process` | VM process table. `spawn`, `exec`, `execFile`, sync variants. |
| `net`, `dgram` | VM TCP, Unix-socket, and UDP tables. |
| `dns`, `dns/promises` | VM DNS resolver. |
| `http`, `https`, `http2`, `tls` | VM socket/TLS paths: clients, servers, pooling. |
| `os` | VM-scoped platform, arch, hostname, CPU, memory, user. |
| `crypto` | Entropy, hashes, HMAC, ciphers, scrypt, UUIDs, WebCrypto. |
| `process` | VM env, cwd, signals, timers, stdio, umask. |
| `module` | `createRequire`, builtin resolution, basic `Module` compat. |
| `console` | Bounded formatting, guest stdout/stderr. |
| `readline`, `sqlite`, `tty` | VM-backed compatibility surfaces. |
| `timers`, `timers/promises` | Timeout, interval, immediate, promise variants. |
| `stream/web`, `stream/consumers`, `stream/promises` | Web Streams + stream helpers. |

- Network builtins obey the VM [permission policy](/agentos/docs/permissions).
- Network access is **denied until granted** by the VM creator.

## In-isolate builtins

- Full: `path`, `buffer`, `events`, `stream`, `util`, `assert`, `url`,
  `querystring`, `string_decoder`, `zlib`, `punycode`, `constants`, `sys`.
  Default and named ESM imports supported.
- Feature-detection shims: `async_hooks`, `diagnostics_channel`, `perf_hooks`,
  `worker_threads`, `vm`, `v8`. `worker_threads` does **not** create real
  worker threads.

## Denied builtins

`cluster`, `domain`, `inspector`, `repl`, `trace_events`, `wasi`.

## Global APIs

- Modern web globals: `fetch`, `Headers`, `Request`, `Response`,
  `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `Buffer`, URL APIs, `Blob`, `File`, `FormData`,
  abort APIs, `structuredClone`, `performance`, WebAssembly.
- `fetch()` uses VM sockets and follows the same policy as `http`/`net`.

## Modules and output

- ESM and CommonJS both use the VM filesystem and normal `node_modules`
  resolution.
- Console/stream output flows through the bounded process-output path — see
  [Processes & Shells](/agentos/docs/processes).

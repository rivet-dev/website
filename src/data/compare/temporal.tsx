		'Compare Rivet and Temporal: stateful realtime actors with durable workflows in one runtime versus a dedicated durable execution platform for orchestration.',
	heroSubtitle:
		'Temporal is a durable execution platform for orchestrating backend workflows behind your API. Rivet combines stateful actors, realtime connections, and durable workflows in one open-source runtime that serves traffic directly.',
	rivetSummary:
		'Rivet is an open-source runtime for stateful backends. Rivet Actors hold persistent state, serve HTTP and WebSocket traffic directly, and include durable workflows with steps, timers, and queue waits, so one runtime covers realtime serving and reliable multi-step execution.',
	competitorSummary:
		'Temporal is a durable execution platform built around workflow-as-code. Workflows run on your worker fleet, coordinate through the Temporal Service with full event-history replay, and recover from failures automatically. It is battle-tested at very large scale and orchestrates work behind your API rather than serving user traffic itself.',

		{
			question: 'Is Rivet an alternative to Temporal?',
			answerHtml:
				'For many workloads, yes. Rivet provides durable, replayable workflows inside Rivet Actors, plus realtime serving that Temporal does not offer. If your workload is pure backend orchestration across many languages, Temporal is a strong choice. If it combines durable logic with stateful realtime serving, Rivet covers both in one runtime. See <a href="https://rivet.dev/actors/docs/workflows/">Rivet workflows</a>.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Does Rivet support durable execution like Temporal?',
			answerHtml:
				'Yes. Rivet workflows persist progress automatically, replay safely after restarts and crashes, and support steps, durable timers, queue waits, and rollback. They run inside Rivet Actors, so durable logic lives next to the state it operates on. See the <a href="https://rivet.dev/actors/docs/workflows/">workflow documentation</a>.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Can Temporal serve WebSockets or user-facing traffic?',
			answerHtml:
				'No. Temporal workers poll task queues over outbound connections and do not terminate HTTP or WebSocket traffic; you build a separate API layer that communicates with workflows through the Temporal Service. Rivet Actors serve HTTP and WebSocket traffic directly from the runtime that holds state.',
		},
		{
			question: 'How does pricing differ between Rivet Cloud and Temporal Cloud?',
			answerHtml:
				'Temporal Cloud bills per action: workflow starts, activities and their retries, signals, queries, updates, and timers all count, with plan minimums starting at $100 per month and no perpetual free tier. Rivet Cloud bills primarily on compute through Awake Actor Hours and includes a free tier, so message-heavy realtime sessions do not multiply costs. See <a href="https://rivet.dev/cloud/">Rivet Cloud pricing</a>.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Is Rivet open source like Temporal?',
			answerHtml:
				'Yes. Rivet is licensed under Apache 2.0 and the Temporal server is MIT-licensed, and both can be self-hosted. Rivet ships as a self-contained engine, while a production Temporal cluster runs four services plus a database and usually Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. The source is at <a href="https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet">github.com/rivet-dev/rivet</a>.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Which languages do Rivet and Temporal support?',
			answerHtml:
				'Temporal has seven GA SDKs (Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, .NET, PHP, and Ruby), with Rust available in preview. Rivet is TypeScript-first with a Rust SDK in preview. If your team orchestrates workflows across many languages today, Temporal has the broader SDK surface.',

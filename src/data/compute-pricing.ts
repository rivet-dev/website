// Configurable Rivet Compute pricing model.

// Rivet Compute meters usage per pool per minute: active instance-seconds, the
// vCPU count, and the memory (GiB) of each running instance. The monthly cost
// is the sum over those minutes of:
//
//   activeSeconds * (memoryRate * memoryGib + cpuRate * vcpu)
//
// Fill in the real `memoryRate` / `cpuRate` coefficients and any included
// allotment below, then flip `finalized` to true. While `finalized` is false
// (or any rate is left null), the docs render a pending-pricing notice instead
// of a rate table so no unverified numbers ship.

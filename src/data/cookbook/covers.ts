// Cover artwork for the cookbook index cards. Every image is a public-domain
// or CC0 artwork hosted on the rivet-assets R2 bucket. Sourcing and license
// details for each work (and verified alternates) are documented in the
// research note "cookbook-cover-image-candidates".
//
// The crop parameters are tuned per artwork so each card centers on the
// painting's focal subject at the tall 5:7 aspect ratio. transform plus
// transformOrigin zooms into a focal point; filter normalizes exposure so the
// covers sit at an even darkness on the black page.

// Documentary-style hover motion, tuned per artwork so the slow close-up
// slides toward that painting's subject (a push onto a face, a descent through
// the dollhouse rooms, a drift toward a light source) rather than in an
// arbitrary direction. `x`/`y` are the layer translate at full zoom; by the
// "to move the camera toward a region, translate the image opposite to it"
// rule, a subject above center pans with positive y and one to the left with
// positive x. Magnitudes stay under (scale - 1) / 2 so the frame never
// reveals its backing.
